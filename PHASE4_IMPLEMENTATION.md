# Phase 4: Integration & Expansion Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 4 deliverables: **Channel Management** and **External Integrations**.

## Overview

Phase 4 adds two critical microservices to the Property Management System (PMS):

1. **Channel Management Service** - Manages booking channels and OTA integrations
2. **Integration Service** - Handles external system integrations

## New Services

### 1. Channel Management Service

**Port:** 8084  
**Base Path:** `/api/channels`

#### Features
- Channel configuration and management
- Support for multiple channel types (OTA, GDS, Direct, etc.)
- Commission tracking
- Channel activation/deactivation
- API endpoint configuration for external channels

#### Channel Types Supported
- `OTA` - Online Travel Agencies (Booking.com, Expedia, etc.)
- `GDS` - Global Distribution Systems
- `CHANNEL_MANAGER` - Channel Managers (SiteMinder, etc.)
- `DIRECT` - Direct bookings
- `CORPORATE` - Corporate booking platforms
- `WHOLESALER` - Wholesaler channels
- `METASEARCH` - Metasearch engines
- `SOCIAL` - Social media platforms

#### Key Endpoints
- `GET /api/channels` - Get all active channels
- `GET /api/channels/{channelCode}` - Get channel by code
- `GET /api/channels/type/{channelType}` - Get channels by type
- `POST /api/channels` - Create new channel
- `PUT /api/channels/{channelId}` - Update channel
- `PATCH /api/channels/{channelId}/status` - Toggle channel status

### 2. Integration Service

**Port:** 8085  
**Base Path:** `/api/integrations`

#### Features
- External system integration management
- Support for multiple integration types
- Integration health testing
- Configuration management
- Retry logic and timeout handling

#### Integration Types Supported
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY` - Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- `ACCOUNTING` - Accounting systems (QuickBooks, SAP, etc.)
- `CRM` - Customer Relationship Management
- `EMAIL` - Email service providers
- `SMS` - SMS service providers
- `REVENUE_MANAGEMENT` - Revenue optimization systems
- `POS` - Point of Sale systems
- `LOYALTY` - Loyalty program systems
- `ANALYTICS` - Analytics platforms
- `AUTHENTICATION` - SSO providers
- And more...

#### Key Endpoints
- `GET /api/integrations` - Get all active integrations
- `GET /api/integrations/{integrationCode}` - Get integration by code
- `GET /api/integrations/type/{integrationType}` - Get integrations by type
- `POST /api/integrations` - Create new integration
- `PUT /api/integrations/{integrationId}` - Update integration
- `POST /api/integrations/{integrationCode}/test` - Test integration connectivity
- `PATCH /api/integrations/{integrationId}/status` - Toggle integration status

## Architecture Integration

### Service Discovery
Both services are registered with Eureka service discovery at `http://localhost:8761/eureka/`

### API Gateway
Gateway routes have been configured in `gateway.yml`:
```yaml
- id: channel-management
  uri: lb://channel-management
  predicates:
    - Path=/api/channels/**
- id: integration-service
  uri: lb://integration-service
  predicates:
    - Path=/api/integrations/**
```

### Database
Both services use PostgreSQL for persistence with JPA/Hibernate for ORM.

### Messaging
Kafka integration is configured for event-driven communication between services.

### Monitoring
Both services expose actuator endpoints for health checks, metrics, and monitoring.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through the centralized configuration service:
- `channel-management.yml` - Channel Management Service configuration
- `integration-service.yml` - Integration Service configuration

## Testing

Unit tests are implemented for both services covering:
- Service layer business logic
- Repository operations
- Controller endpoints

## Future Enhancements

The foundation is now in place for:
1. Implementing specific OTA protocol integrations (XML, REST APIs)
2. Adding payment gateway specific implementations
3. Building workflow automation for channel distribution
4. Implementing real-time synchronization
5. Adding advanced monitoring and alerting
6. Implementing data mapping and transformation layers

## Getting Started

1. Start the infrastructure services (Discovery, Configuration, Gateway)
2. Start the new services:
   ```bash
   # Channel Management Service
   cd channel-management && mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # Integration Service  
   cd integration-service && mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Access services through the API Gateway at `http://localhost:9000`

## API Examples

### Create a new OTA channel:
```bash
POST http://localhost:9000/api/channels
{
  "channelCode": "BOOKING_COM",
  "channelName": "Booking.com",
  "channelType": "OTA",
  "active": true,
  "commissionPercentage": 15.0,
  "apiEndpoint": "https://secure-supply-xml.booking.com/hotels/xml/",
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

### Create a payment gateway integration:
```bash
POST http://localhost:9000/api/integrations
{
  "integrationCode": "STRIPE_PAYMENT",
  "integrationName": "Stripe Payment Gateway",
  "integrationType": "PAYMENT_GATEWAY",
  "active": true,
  "baseUrl": "https://api.stripe.com",
  "apiKey": "sk_test_...",
  "timeoutSeconds": 30,
  "retryAttempts": 3
}
```
